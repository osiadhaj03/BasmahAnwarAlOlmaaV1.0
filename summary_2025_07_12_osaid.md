## What Was Accomplished Today (in detail):

1. Database Tables Setup:
   - lessons: Contains lesson information, links each lesson to a teacher, includes lesson times/dates, type, and status.
   - lesson_student: Pivot table to link students to lessons (student enrollment).
   - attendances: Records each student's attendance for each lesson.

2. Building Relationships in Models:
   - Each lesson is linked to one teacher (teacher_id in lessons).
   - Each lesson is linked to multiple students (students via lesson_student).
   - Each lesson has attendance records (attendances).
   - Added appropriate relationships in the User model to distinguish between teacher and student by type.

3. System Management Scenario:
   - Admin: Manages teachers, students, lessons, attendance; can add, edit, and delete.
   - Teacher: Views and manages only their own lessons, enrolled students, and attendance.
   - Student: Views enrolled lessons, can enroll in new lessons, and sees their attendance.

4. Importance of RelationManager in Filament:
   - RelationManager allows displaying and managing related records (e.g., students enrolled in a lesson, their attendance).
   - Customize RelationManager to show only relevant data based on user type (admin, teacher, student).
   - Practical example: For a specific lesson, RelationManager displays enrolled students and their attendance.

5. Setting Up Relationships in Models and Linking to Tables:
   - Added relationship methods (teacher, students, attendances) in the Lesson model.
   - Added relationship methods (lessons for teacher, lessons for student) in the User model.

6. Discussion of the First Task (RelationManager):
   - The first task discussed is to create a RelationManager in LessonResource to display enrolled students and their attendance for each lesson.
   - Need to create StudentsRelationManager and AttendancesRelationManager and link them to the lesson.

## Plan for Tomorrow:

1. Create RelationManagers in LessonResource:
   - StudentsRelationManager: To manage students enrolled in the lesson.
   - AttendancesRelationManager: To manage student attendance in the lesson.

2. Customize RelationManagers in UserResource:
   - For teachers: Display their lessons, enrolled students, and attendance.
   - For students: Display enrolled lessons and their attendance.

3. Set up authorization based on user type.

4. Test the system to ensure correct data display for each user type.
